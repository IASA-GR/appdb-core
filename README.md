The [EGI Applications Database](http://appdb.egi.eu) (AppDB) is a central service that stores and provides to the public, information about:

* **software solutions** in the form of native [software](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_register_a_software) products and [virtual appliances](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_register_a_virtual_appliance),
* the **programmers** and the **scientists** who are involved, and
* **publications** derived from the registered solutions

Reusing software products, registered in the AppDB, means that scientists and developers may find a solution that can be directly utilized on the [European Grid & Cloud Infrastructures](http://www.egi.eu/) without reinventing the wheel. This way, scientists can spend less or even no time developing, porting or even using a software solution to the Distributed Computing Infrastrures (DCIs). AppDB, thus, aims to avoid duplication of effort across the DCI communities, and to inspire scientists less familiar with DCI programming and usage.

The EGI Applications Database **is open to every scientist**, interested on publishing and therefore sharing, his/her software solution. The only prerequisite, is to be owner of a valid [account](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_get_access_to_the_appdb). After that, you will be able to take advantage of the authenticated write-enabled features of the AppDB service and more specific to register your [software](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_register_a_software) products and [virtual appliances](https://wiki.appdb.egi.eu/main:faq:how_to_register_a_virtual_appliance).
