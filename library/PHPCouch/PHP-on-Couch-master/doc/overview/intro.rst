Introduction
============

`PHPOnCouch <http://github.com/PHP-on-Couch/PHP-on-Couch/>`_ tries to provide an easy way to work with your `CouchDB <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`_ `documents <http://docs.couchdb.org/>`_ with `PHP <http://php.net/>`_ .

What's new
==========

Due to the lack of support on the last repository, I forked it and I will make sure it's kept active. Feel free to post any issue or feature request. I'm open for further developments but I don't have a lot of time.

With the new release of 2.0, the master branch will support only this version and the next one.
